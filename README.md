TravelLogs
==========

A plugin for Bukkit Minecraft servers. Players can "remember" locations that they have visited, allowing them to recall them at a later date. Recalling a location does not teleport or warp you, it simply points your compass toward the location and gives you distance information.

Obviously, compasses and distances cannot be calculated across worlds, so any locations in a player's Travel Log that are recalled while in a different world will only say: You must first travel to the world that this location exists in.


Commands:

/travellog or /tl

list: list all locations in this world
list all: list all locations
remember <name>: save the current location to your travel log as <name>
recall <name>: recall a location from your travel log
forget <name>: remove a location from your travel log
share <name> <player>: share a location with another player
